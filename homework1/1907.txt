HARRIS:        Attention all units
in the vicinity     of South Park Elementary.
We have a code red.
[ Gun cocks ]    Principal calling for help      during school assembly.
All officers needed at once.
The school?       [ Engine turns over ]
Oh, geez Louise!
[ Sirens wailing,        tires screeching ]
[ Guns cocking ]
[ Tires screech,         glass shatters ]
We need to get to the gym.
Half go this way,     half go around the side.
Barbrady,        you go around back.
[ Breathing heavily ]
On 3.
1...2...
There she is, officers,           right there.
I told you to stop chatting with  your friends, didn't I, Leslie?
You see, officers,     apparently, Leslie thinks
that talking to her friends         is more important
than learning about diversity     in third-world countries.
It's that one.
That's her, right there.  You remove her from my school.
Aah! Nobody move!              What's happening?!
Get her out of here!              Oh, they've got me!
[ Gunshot ]               Aah!
Aah!
This town is outraged,         Officer Barbrady.
People are tired of the police
not being held accountable        for their actions.
Mayor, I didn't know if there     was a gunman or a bomb --
You shot an unarmed         6-year-old Latino child.
I'm sorry.
You are fired.
No, Mayor, please.
This is all I know.
I used to be the only policeman      in this town, remember?
Bob, I-I used to chase away    the sixth graders for you.
You're from another time,             Barbrady,
and the last thing         that needs to go.
Your gun and your badge.
And your sunglasses.
No. Please.        Not my sunglasses.
You're done,                   Barbrady.
The town doesn't                want you here.
Where should I go?
You should have thought of that       before you shot a Mexican.
[ Whispering ]         Latino American.
Latino American.                     Shit.
You should go away.
You don't belong anywhere
in a town    as progressive as this one.
Hey, quiet down over there. I'm trying to sleep.
God damn it.  You people all get out of here!
What makes you      in charge?
'Cause this             is my fucking house!
[ Drum thuds ]
Hey, beat it, man,
or I'll make you             my bitch!
Aah!
Yeah, we've got a bunch          of drug-addict vagrants
trespassing in our yard,          and we need assistance.
Oh, is that so?
Well,    we'd like to come help you,
but we don't want to get fired.
What are              you talking about?
There's homeless people here,     and they're scaring my kids.
You need to come         do something about this.
I see.
And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
Why does that matter?
Oh, it matters.
See, used to be we could beat up   minorities, and nobody cared.
It's the reason a lot of us         joined the force.
Hey, Mitch, you want to go down and arrest some homeless people,
but not be able to beat up          any minorities?
No, thank you.
Yeah, no,        I think we're good.
In fact, we're thinking of maybe
turning the whole department        into a hula school.
What do you think?
God damn it!
What are they doing?!
They're not coming!
But they have to!
Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!
Well,              it's just too bad.
The cops won't come,
so there's nobody      to scare the homeless away.
[ Lock disengages,          door squeaks ]
Hey, sweetheart.
I've, uh -- I've been let go          from the force.
I'm so sorry.
[ Dog whimpers ]
Don't worry, old girl.
Might be a little tough    to afford your medication,
but I'll find a way.
You know me.
I like to help.
I like to be needed.
You guys! Oh, my God, you guys!
You guys, they're gay!       They're totally gay.
Who?
Kenny and Token.
What?
Kenny and Token, dude.
They're so gay.         Butters told me.
You're lying.             No, dude.
In those old, abandoned  buildings around Kenny's house,
Kenny and Token turned it    into a big ninja clubhouse,
and they dress up       and play ninja in it,
trying to scare people away.
How is that gay?
It's the gayest thing ever,               dude!
Ninjas are fucking dumb!
Dude, come on!      We got to go see this!
Over this way!
[ Traditional Japanese music              plays ]
Wah!       Wah, wah!
Hoo-ah, wah, wah!
We will defend our ninja honor.
Wo-chew, wo-chew!
Intruders!         Defend the base!
[ Music continues ]
Hey, guys, did you come    to see our ninja fortress?
[ Gong crashes ]               Oh, my God.        They're so gay, you guys.
You and Kenny                  built all this?
Yeah,    with Clyde and David, too.
You guys should come   and check it out.
Uh, no.              We're good, thanks.
Oh, my God, dude.            It's a sausage party.
It's pretty cool, dude. People are really scared of us.
Yeah,              I'm sure they are.
Hey, excuse me, man.             Do you know where --
[ Middle Eastern music plays ]
Aah! Aahhhh!
[ All grunting ]
Oh, my God!
Go, go, go!         [ Tires squeal ]
[ Engine revs, tires squeal ]
That's pretty cool.
Well, the way I heard it was    that the girl in the school
wasn't even doing anything,      just talking too loud,
and someone ends up           getting shot.
Hey!         What do you want?
It's okay.           I'm off-duty.
Just came         for a nice Pinot.
Yeah? Well,       go somewhere else, copper.
ShiTpaTown is for people       who care about each other.
We don't take kindly
to folks who impose          their authority
on the underprivileged.
Now, look, not all cops
are racist,      trigger-happy assholes.
Really?
I'll bet you don't even know      what "farm-to-table" means.
-Yeah!            -All right!
Wow.
We've only had a Whole Foods           for a month,
and already, we don't need cops.
So cool.
It is a great honor to see  that you all want to be ninjas.
Joining our club         is very serious.
You must promise to uphold        the warrior's code.
Totally, dude.         Ninjas are sweet.
Together, we must strive to make     our fortress super badass
and keep all intruders out.
To that end, let us proceed         to our training.
Dude, can I talk to you     for a minute?
Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay?
He said ninjas were gay.
He's probably gonna try to turn it around on me,
but that's 'cause Kyle knows     I heard him.
You're talking to Kyle                  right now.
Yeah, cool.
It's me -- Butters.
You're the one who said               ninjas were gay.
Why do you want to make this                  a problem?
I'm --      I'm just Butters, man.
I have problems       with lots of things.
Hey, Eric, you want to try sparring with me?!
Yes I do, Butters.
Ooh! Ow!      [ Coughs ]
Intruders!
Yeah,  it's right up here.
We can shoot up in these abandoned buildings.
[ All grunting ]
[ Middle Eastern music plays ]
Aah! Aah!       Aah. Aah!
The town of South Park
is holding      a large protest tonight
outside of their        police department.
The townspeople say the protest   is meant to begin a dialogue
about the relationship between          law enforcement
and the citizens   they are supposed to protect.

Are your children being lured   into terrorist organizations?
A shocking report shows
that some kids in the town           of South Park
are swearing loyalty      to a murderous regime.
Yeah, we're pretty badass,
and, um, this is, like,     our fortress,
and you can see   it's pretty cool.
MAN: And what about this way   of life is attractive to you?
BUTTERS: Well, it's just cool        'cause we're tough,
and we fight and stuff.
And we can --     Yeah, yeah, yeah!
And it's like we can do whatever we want,
and people are scared        of us.
It's totally rad.
Then why did you say it was gay before?
Oh, my God!  I never said it was gay!
Wait,            he said this was gay?
That is a total lie!
Why would I say something homophobic
about the way Tweek and Craig make love?
He's a lying,   backstabbing Jew!
I'm Stan.
No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS
could be problematic     for the progressive town.
Here you go, old girl.
We'll just have to make do.
Ew!
Spare a dollar?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. Thank you.
God damn it. Ew.
Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town
to have it overrun with homeless people.
Why are they all       suddenly coming here?
Mayor, what are you going               to do about this?
My wife and I          can barely eat or shop.
When a town like ours      has a homeless problem,
it must look at the root       of what's causing it.
It's ISIS!  What?
There's these troubled kids
who've turned their backs      on America.
They've taken over SodoSoPa, forced all the homeless out.
Why would kids in our town       want to be a part of that?
They're just bad kids,
rotten on the inside, probably with shitty parents.
Son, I've always tried   to be a fair dad.
I-I don't want to make you angry, but why?
Well dad, I just r-r-really like    being a part of something.
I feel like it's        character-building,
and it's lots of fun.
Fun?
But what do you...      believe in?
What do we believe in?
We believe in something greater          than ourselves,
and that by following     our strict warrior code,
we believe that our faiths        and our traditions
are a way to a greater path --   the p-p-path of the warrior.
And as long as we stay united             in honor,
we can defeat all our enemies.
Waghgh waaaaghghhhg!
Wow.      The fellas were right.
People are really freaked out            by ninjas.
Okay, we've just got to be really apologetic
and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?
Geez.     This is so embarrassing.
What if they won't help us              with the homeless?
I'm pretty sure the police will help out
if it's because ISIS is taking over the town.
[ Hawaiian music plays ]
Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS.
We don't know who they are,      but they --
What?       What's that, you say?
The town is in danger,                  all right?
We don't know  what these kids are capable of.
Geez. I'm sorry.
We've got to work        on our Kaholo Koloa
and get the lomilomi chicken  ready for the big Ho'olaule'a,
which leaves us, oh,
not enough time        to deal with ISIS.
All right, look,          there's homeless people
all over our gentrified          food-and-arts district.
If you don't stop      these twisted kids, then --
Hey, who was it that said        "Fuck the police"?
Was that Ice Cube?              Tupac?
Oh, right.        That was you guys.
Sorry, but I guess you'll have       to find somebody else
to do all the difficult,            dirty shit
you don't want to do yourselves.
I got to be ready for the luau.
I might even kiss a dude.
So, then,  after you told me,
we both went over   to Kyle and Stan,
where they were playing basketball, remember?
Yeah.
And we said Kenny and Token  were playing ninja,
and Kyle said that ninjas were gay.
And I said, "Ninjas are gay?" But it was a question.
You remember?
I thought              you said it first.
No, no, no, no.
See, now, Kyle's got everyone remembering it wrong
because he doesn't want to get kicked out of the group.
That's what Jews do when they're caught in a lie.
You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters.
TOKEN:        You guys, you guys!
STAN: What?
Actual ninjas  want to talk to us.
What?
Kenny and I both just got
the same e-mail from people overseas.
Whoa, dude!
How'd they find out                 who we were?
They're fucking ninjas,               dude!
[ Static hissing ]
So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause.
We have heard      of what you are doing,
and we are very impressed.
Cool.                 Thanks, dude.
What you are doing        is very important,
and we would like to help you          however we can.
We are going   to be wiring you some money.
Whoa! Cool!
This is the greatest thing ever,                   you guys!
Uh, excuse me,
could I just set the record straight on something?
Of course.
Should Jews be trusted?
I mean, if one of us is a Jew,
do you see that as being at all problematic?
Extremely.
Yes!
Yes!
[ "U Can't Touch This"       by MC Hammer plays ]          Oh, oh, oh, oh!
What did I tell you guys?            Thank you!
RANDY:                Hey, Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady?
[ Dog whimpers, pants ]
Wha-- who?
Hey, buddy.
What do you want?
How would you like to be a policeman again?
I'm no good as a policeman.
I'm a bumbling, old fool.
That is not true.                 Who said that?!
Look, Barbrady, the fact is,              the town needs you.
They need me?      To do what?
We need you        to shoot some kids.
No! Shoot kids?!
I don't want    to shoot kids!           Shh, shh, shh!
These are really bad kids --            terrorists.
This is totally different           from before.
Oh!
Are any of them      minorities?
A couple of them we think,         yeah.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Shh!         Look, look, look!
Barbrady! Barbrady!
We were wrong about you.           I was wrong about you.
You protected this town
back before           anybody else ever did.
You used to do it               all on your own.
We need you               to do that again.
You're the only cop       this town needs, Barbrady.
Go shoot those kids.

CARTMAN: Guys, I know this is  hard for all of us,
but to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts.
Last night, I spoke in private  with our ninja leader overseas.
We talked a long time about Jews       and the Hebrew faith.
He told me a lot I didn't know,
and I was able to tell him   some things he did not know.
But after talking with that guy,
it is abundantly clear to me    that Jews cannot be ninjas.
I went to Kyle's house     to talk to him about it,
and I found this.
It was then     that Kyle confessed to me
about how he had brainwashed  Butters and Stan into thinking
I had used a homophobic slur   to refer to our organization.
And he almost got away with it.
That's when Kyle tried            to kill me.
Luckily, I was the faster ninja.
Kyle knew I would never         call ninjas gay.
When I take the gag off,
he's going to try and tell you        that I'm lying now.
Do not believe him.                Kyle is a liar.
KYLE:          I'm right here.
Who -- Who's this?
STAN:                 That's Clyde.
And I am Token.
Why do I do these things,       you ask?
Black rage.
[ Insects chirping ]
[ Middle Eastern music playing ]
[ Gasps ] Oh, Jesus.
ISIS. Oh, God.
This chicken tastes like shit.             What'd you do to it?
Okay -- Okay, Dad,     it's not organic chicken.
I'm not comfortable shopping          at Whole Foods
with all the homeless people              there.
But don't worry, that's all about to change.
Soon we'll all have ShiTpaTown          to enjoy again.
Where's Stan?
He's playing ninjas over   at Kenny's house.
Ninjas?            That's gay.
He's playing ninjas         at Kenny's house?
Yeah.
You mean SodoSoPa?    Uh-huh.
Wait a minute...

Gay!
Staaaan!!
CARTMAN: Oh, I get     the misunderstanding now!
No, see, I told Clyde  that Kyle said ninjas were gay,
but Clyde thought I was Kyle,
so then he was saying   that I said ninjas were gay.
Meaning I as in Kyle.
KYLE: Nobody ever gave       a shit, you fat turd.
TOKEN:  All those in favor
of Cartman being kicked out  of our ninjas club?
ALL: Hai!
No!      You can't kick me out!
I have to be a ninja.
They hate Jews.  I was made for this, you guys!
Please!
STAN: What should we     do with him?
Freeze!
Oh, shit!
Please!    I don't want to shoot you!
STAN: Cool. Don't.
[ Groaning ]
[ Children flinch ]
I understand you're feeling        angry at this town.
I'm getting        pretty angry, too!
But we can't give up on it.
Please, boys...
Don't make this end violently.
They're just                stupid ninjas!
DAVID: Aah!!
Aaaah!!
What were you thinking?
Boys innocently playing ninja,  and you pull your gun on them?
David Rodriguez  was lucky to live.
Everybody told me       they were terrorists!
We thought they were!
But if it turns out they aren't,          as a policeman,
you have to figure that out!
But...You said you needed me to kill some kids!
Oh, he's gonna  lay this on us now.
I said "kill some kids,"
but I said it as a question, remember?
I said,   "Kill some kids?"
I'm sorry, but we just can't    cover your ass on this one.
There's going to be      an investigation and...
You just don't have           what it takes
to be a policeman         in today's times.
Do you even know      what "farm to table" means?
[ Siren chirps ]
Let's go, people.       You can't stay here.
You are being relocated.
Hey, you can't kick us   out of here, man.
Oh, no? I'm a cop.
Thank you, officers.
We've got a deal,                    right?
Yes.
All right, you.                   Come on.
Aah!
Please! You can't take me back                 to SodoSoPa!
ISIS is there!
No, those   were just ninjas.
Ninjas?
Oh, that's so gay.
I told you guys.
What did I tell you?
I said          ninjas are fucking gay,
but you didn't want                  to listen.
Nooo.
[ Door opens ]
Officer Barbrady?
Yes?
We've been     watching you.
And what we see
is a man who truly wants to protect his town.
You do?
You've been in this town longer than almost anyone.
Have you noticed...    changes lately?
Yeah,               a lot of changes.
They aren't a coincidence, officer.
They are all    part of a plan
to take down your beloved town  and everyone in it.
What?
What do you know about a little girl named...
Leslie?
[ Dramatic music playing ]
There she is, officers,           right there.
I told you to stop chatting with  your friends, didn't I, Leslie?
You see, officers,     apparently, Leslie thinks
that talking to her friends         is more important
than learning about diversity     in third-world countries.
It's that one.
That's her, right there.  You remove her from my school.
