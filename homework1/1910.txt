âª Ample parking day or night âª

[ Wind whistling ]
All right, everyone, listen up.
I don't know about you,          but I, for one,
am sick and tired of hate speech
that serves      to marginalize others.
[ Speaking foreign language ]
[ Gulp ] Ahh.
You know, if there's one thing        that makes me sick,
it's when a race thinks         they're superior
and don't know how     to check their privilege.
An African American flips       a turtle over on its back.
A transgender                Filipino comes
and sees the helpless turtle          baking in the sun.
What color is           the Filipino's father?
I didn't think                you were human.
Aah!
Yeah, everybody's pretty   freaked out over here, baby.
Everyone is on edge    and feeling really nervous.
That sounds terrible.       Be careful, Butters.
I will, honey.
Butters, get to  the bathroom. Now.
All right, Kyle,  what's this about?
Jimmy's dead.
What?
I know the whole story.      PC Principal killed him
and tried to kill Leslie,         but she got away.
Mrph rmh rmphm?
PC Principal is part   of a huge network of radicals
who kill everyone that doesn't     follow their PC ideology.
How do you know all this?
Because Leslie's with me.       I'm keeping her safe.
[ Chuckles ]    âª Kyle's got a girlfriend âª
It gets worse.
Someone in our town helped          these people come here.
That person     faked the Bill Cosby joke
to get     Principal Victoria fired.
Who would use a Cosby joke        to push their own agenda?
I think it's obvious --            Stan's dad.
Kyle...
Stan, your dad is                 one of them.
He had to be the one               that let them in!
You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you.
There's no way to know    who we can trust.
So, what do we do now?
There's only one thing       we<i> can</i> do.
We have to get guns.
Guns?
It's the only way for us            to be safe.
Kyle, even if we thought        it could help protect us,
how are we all going to          get our hands on guns?
[ Guns cocking ]
All right, cool.           We got guns.
So, now what?
Mrph rmhmhm rm!
I already feel     a lot safer!
You guys lay low            and watch your backs.
I'm gonna go           keep Leslie protected.
Hey.
Don't fall too hard,                   partner.
Do I look sweet,                   Butters?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
What?
What?
Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?
Why wouldn't I be able     to pass the garlic bread?
Dad, where were you      last night?
What? When?         Where was I what?
Out. With friends.           Doing things.
Well, I'm full.
I'm gonna go work in the garage         for a little bit.
Work on what?
On stuff          that do things.
Um, oh, I'm gonna take       some of this with me.
I'm still hungry.
Thought you just said    you were full.
Jesus!
What am I, on trial          or something?!
God damn!
You guys are really          acting strange.
All right.      We're good.
Nobody suspects a thing.
Take a look at this.
We've got everything  from PC Principal's hard drive.
He was on to the gentrification         around the world,
and he was convinced
that whatever was responsible           wasn't human.
Not human?                  Then what?
I don't care   if they're aliens or vampires.
We need to                round 'em up fast
and fuck them               till they're dead.
You don't want to fuck a vampire.
You'll get hepatitis.
Oh, girlfriend,           I am well beyond that.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, my God.  Don't you see what this means?
If something not human is gentrifying the entire world,
soon no human will be able           to afford it.
They're trying to price   our species out of existence.
Well, how do you like              my new apartment?
What happened to you,              Nathan?
I always thought       you were a nice kid.
Now you've got a gun?
Oh, everyone's getting      one of these now, Jim.
Nobody knows who to trust.
Yeah? Well,    guns are never the answer.
Don't you kind of wish           you'd had one
back when Leslie betrayed you   and nearly beat you to death?
Oh. I guess it would have been       a decent answer then.
T-T-T-TouchÃ©.
You see, I've got     expensive tastes, Jimmy.
I like good food,          organic pressed juices,
and I've got a thing      for high-class prostitutes.
Have you been introduced        to my current girlfriend?
My name is Classi           with an "I,"
and a little dick        hanging off the "C"
that bends around         and fucks the "L"
out of the           "A"-"S"-"S."
Nice to meet you,              Classi.
All I had to do       was work for the ads,
and I got      everything I wanted --
My own loft with all of ShiTpaTown right at my doorstep.
All it took was some PC, and the  whole thing was set in motion.
Oh, great.
So, now ads are using PC       for their own gains?
That's a new low.
What is PC but a verbal form        of gentrification?
Spruce everything up,    get rid of all the ugliness
in order to create    a false sense of paradise.
Only one thing can actually live       in that world -- ads.
I know I've set it before,      but man, do I hate ads.
Eric Cartman, I told you to go get ready for bed!
Yeah, I just want to finish              this movie.
No, Eric, this is a school night.
Mom,             I'm into this movie.
I'm not going to bed              right now. Chillax.
You most certainly are.
Right now, mister!
I will go to bed    when this movie is over, Mom.
Eric!     Where did you get that?!
Turn off the light              and go back to bed.
I'm staying up.
Eric, you march right up to your room, and you --
I don't think so, Mom.
Eric, you get   your butt to bed!
No means no,                  Bill Cosby!
I told you to go upstairs        right now!
Whoa, Mom,                what the hell?
I'm not going to tell you again, Eric.
It is time   for night-night!
Mom, put down the gun.
I am your mother, and you will       do what I tell you!
Okay, I am going!
Well, then you go        right now, mister!
I am going to bed Mom!        Chillax.
All right, then! No comic books!          Just straight to sleep!
I love you, sweetie!
Okay. I love you too, Mom.        Night-night.
[ Door shuts ]
Wow, he -- he listened.
There has to be                 something --
some clue as to what              we're dealing with.
The news stories      PC Principal researched
are all so contradictory,
as if whatever         these things are
have control      over the news somehow.
That sounds             like vampires to me.
We have to find out who had me    fired with the Cosby joke.
It's the key to knowing     what we're dealing with.
STAN:  Principal Victoria?
Mr. Garrison?    Caitlyn Jenner?
Stan, what the hell      are you doing in here?!
Tell me what's going on, Dad.
Nothing.      We're just hanging out,
talking about Coldplay,            all right?
No! I want to know what the hell is going on right now!
What are you doing                  with that?
Kyle said I couldn't trust you.
What are you    planning, Dad?
Stan, it isn't          what you think.
Then what is it?
Look, I need to show you         something, okay?
You need         to see this, son.
Ooh! Psych! Now put   the fucking gun down, bitch!
I'm gonna go tell Mom!
Oh, yeah?         You go tell her.
I'll tell you had a gun.
You'll be     in more trouble than me!
Stan, I am your dad.
Put the gun down        and sit over there.
Mom!               Shit!
Took a lot to hunt you down,           PC Principal.
You mind telling me why you're going around the world
shooting up revitalized arts and foods districts?
You wouldn't believe me          if I told you.
Try me!
I don't know what they are,         but they used me
and others like me   to try and change the planet.
You don't know     what<i> who</i> are?
Sir, the President is                on the phone.
Wants to talk to you        about PC Principal.
Yes, Mr. President.
I see, sir.        Yes, I understand.
We're to release him          immediately --
No questions asked.
And we're not supposed to   believe anything he tells us.
Huh.        Ain't that a peach?
He's being set free now,              Mr. President.
Can I tell              the commander why?
[ As Obama ] This is a matter       of national security.
I understand, sir.
Thank you.          God Bless you.
God Bless you,                   too, sir.
And may God Bless   the United States of America.
You okay?
Yeah, just             feeling butterflies,
and my hands                 are freezing.
Here.
Thank you, Kyle.
Don't worry, Leslie.
I won't let anything    happen to you.
I'm warning you -- You're on the wrong side of this.
We're just trying    to get answers.
You pulled a gun  on our son, Randy!
He pulled one             on me first, Sharon!
Because you wouldn't               talk to me, Dad!
Stanley, let your mother and I          deal with this.
I told you  to leave him alone!
God,        I hate this family!
Why are you always       taking Stan's side?!
Whoa! Whoa! Shelly!
Put down the gun,                    Shelly!
You're always acting like Stan     can't do anything wrong!
She doesn't always                 take my side!
You shut up or I swear to God          I'll use this.
Shelly,               put it down now.
You don't even try         to know me, Dad!
I want to, Shelly!
I just sometimes feel              like you hate me!
I feel like <i>you</i> hate<i> me,</i> Randy!
I don't hate you!                  I love you!
I need to be a better husband,          a better father!
We all need to be better                   to each other!
Okay, maybe I need      to stop being so angry!
I love you guys.
We love you,                        too, Dad.
We just want to know        what's going on with you.
All right,     I'll tell you everything.
Wow. These things           are amazing.
[ Cash register dings ]
All right,      Mrs. Farnickle, enjoy.
And remember -- If the safety's     on, you're good as gone.
Okay, and next customer,              please.
Ah, going for         the big one, huh?
You must be feeling           extra jumpy!
you don't know          the half of it.
Well, this thing should make you        feel more at ease.
You know, you ought to          check out the gun show.
The gun show?
Yeah, it's gonna have            everything,
and with guns being so popular,
practically everyone in town is      gonna be in attendance.
The entire town         in one location?
Oh, my God.
The principal has become       our biggest problem.
We need a news headline that will draw him back to town.
Oh, you're going to
sponsor my content               some more, baby?
I'm all ears.
I've got to get to      the<i> Super School News.</i>
Hey, Classi, do you think   you could get me my crutches?
[ Tsks ] Naw.
I don't think Nathan would like that.
You seem like       a reasonable person.
Do you really want to live   in a world controlled by ads?
I mean come on, Classy.
No, it's<i> Classi.</i>     With an "I."
The little dick that hangs off the "C"
fucks the "L"    out of the ass.
<i> Cla-ass-i.</i>
Sorry. My bad.
Look, I'm a news reporter,            <i> Claaassi,</i>
and in a world where ads         control the news,
there's no way to be sure anyone's ever hearing the truth.
Truth about what?
LESLIE:        We can't just hide, Kyle.
We have to let people know             PC is the enemy
before it's too late.
Leslie, we don't know who is on their side.
We have stay safe.
The principal is           going to try
and make up         some crazy story.
That's what PC people do.
You have to get             in front of everyone
and tell them             what you've learned!
I...gave up   giving speeches.
But why?
I came to you              because I had heard
how good you were      at getting messages across.
That and because...         I thought you were cute.
I'm sure I'd have no problem        giving a speech
if you could be      by my side.
well, I can't go with you,    you know. It's too dangerous.
Not if we go somewhere
that's completely safe   from any violence.
Where?   The gun show.
Gun show?
There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen.
Someone purposely had    Principal Victoria replaced
with the new principal?
Yes, they wanted           to use his PC
as a means to start    gentrification in our town.
That's why we thought PC Principal was behind it,
but now we know they were just using his PC abilities
to service   their own needs.
When the pussy crusher story   came out in<i> Super School News,</i>
it started to make PC Principal         question himself.
He started digging for answers.      They didn't like that.
So, they tried to distract    and mislead him with this.
[ Keyboard clicking ]
Sorry. Wait. That's an ad     for McDonald's. Hold on.
With this --    Ugh, there's that ad again.
God, these things           are annoying.
Anyways,    whatever these beings are,
they try to keep anyone  from knowing the truth from --
Ugh, I don't want to see           a slide show.
PC Principal said something       was trying to divert
and distract his   subconscious mind with this.
Wait, that's Leslie.
Oh, my God.      It's Kyle.
Kyle?
Kyle's been protecting Leslie.         They're together.
He's been making everyone           feel paranoid
and saying      <i> you're</i> the enemy, Dad.
Well, then,     it's time to go ask Kyle
why he sold out           his own kind.
How will we get him       to talk?
We're going to kill him          with kindness.
But instead of kindness,     we're going to use guns.
Yeah!               Yeah!
Come on! Let's go!
Shelly,     you take care of Grandpa!
Okay!
No, no, no.       Don't<i> shoot</i> Grandpa.
Just literally         take care of him.
[ Guns cocking ]
Buckle up, buckaroos!
[ Dog barks ]
Here it is, Jimmy, hot off the presses.
What is that?
The newest edition of<i> Super School News,</i>
hitting the streets       tomorrow.
"Tragedy at Gun Show."
What happened         at the gun show?
Not what's happened, what's going to happen.
The final sweeping  underneath the rug.
By this time tomorrow,
nobody will be asking questions ever again.
The ads will have won, and I will be the man.
I think the ads              are playin' yo ass.
Shut up, Classi!
Oh,<i> hell, no!</i>
What?
Oh, hell no, your Down syndrome             ass just slapped me.
I'mma break                 yo dick off!
Hang on, Classi.      I'm sorry.
I will bust                yo fucking ass!
I will bust              yo fucking nose!
I ain't no                 mimsy-ass ho!
I'm a classy bitch,
and I do not...
want ads...
controlling my news!
[ Groans ]
Classi, thank you!
You need my help?                 You gots it.
I need your phone     to call Officer Barbrady,
and we have to get to        that gun show fast!
Quick, to  the Classi-mobile!
[ Engine turns over ]
ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to the South Park Gun Show.
We've had over 2,000 gorgeous guns
come through   this arena today.
It's been whittled down        to seven,
the winners   from each group.
David, take us down the line.
DAVID: First, we have    the beautiful Yorkshire .33mm
with proud owner                Steven Stotch.
An absolutely gorgeous gun,           David.
The playful and lovely       Australian semi-automatic,
owned by Father Maxi.
And there's the Mayor  with her delightful
Rhodesian Ridgeback  shotgun/rifle mix.
That's a favorite              of the crowd here.
Always a favorite    at these shows.
That's a nice gun           right there.
The judge now asking to see   that Yorkshire .33mm up close.
And there it is --  Just a beautiful gun in motion.
Everybody loves it.
[ Applause ]
Looks like the judge wants to take another look
at that  shotgun/rifle mix.
[ Applause ]
And next up will be the --
Nobody move!        [ Crowd screaming ]
Everyone just stay                where you are!
ANNOUNCER: And it looks like the gun show     is under attack, David.
[ Screaming stops ]
Yes, six armed gunmen          have entered the arena,
one of which is carrying           an absolutely gorgeous
little Pekingese                   Glock 17.
Listen to me, everyone!
There are beings         who are purposely
gentrifying the Earth
so that humans     can no longer afford it.
We've been looking       for Kyle Broflovski.
Somebody's hiding him.
Don't listen to them!
The real conspiracy here       are the PC extremists
who have        no problem killing
whoever doesn't think           like they do!
You son of a bitch,         Stan.
How could you have sided      with the enemy?
Fuck you, Kyle.         You're the enemy.
You've both got it wrong.
Jimmy?
Officer Barbrady?
Classi?
Randy?
Kyle, I know       you probably thought
Leslie was       a kind, caring girl,
but the truth is         she's just an ad.
An ad?
They've               become sentient!
They've taken                  human form.
You can't tell what's human        and what's an ad anymore.
Oh, geez.         Are you serious?
How am I supposed to       fuck an ad to death?
Ugh, flippin' ads.
They're such  a pain in the ass.
You told me    Jimmy was dead.
So, now we know who got     Principle Victoria fired.
Nobody move, m'kay!
Everyone just              stay where you are!
Mackey?
Yes, I wanted     Principle Victoria fired,
but I didn't want           any of this!
<i> You</i> got me fired? Why?!
18 years of answering to you --             18 years!
You always telling me            what to do.
If you had problems with me,  why didn't you just talk to me?
You never listened!
Nobody listens to me!
They just expect me        to listen to<i> them!</i>
Maybe we should           have realized
that sometimes a counselor         needs counseling!
I don't know.      Maybe I got manipulated
by these ads,           too, somehow,
but I should have been         a better person!
We all could be better people --            all of us!
We all played a part.
Maybe from now on people in this  town need to communicate more!
Care about each other!
If we're going to defeat           our enemies,
that's what it's going to   take -- all of us, together!
[ Sighs ]
If only we'd had these           before, huh?
Every time you block us,          we get smarter.
Every time you try to stop us,           we are more.
If one plan fails,       we will plan another.
You will never          be rid of ads.
PC PRINCIPAL:                 Hey, Leslie!
Your species took PC and   twisted it for evil purposes.
That pisses me off!
You're expelled.
Yes, dude!
Well, I guess there's just  one last thing to take care of.
Why did it have to be            like this?!
Why couldn't we try to live     on this planet together?!
Maybe we're not perfect beings,    but we built a better town!
We didn't need you            to do that!
And we'll keep on trying        to make it better!
Randy, you're yelling   at a Whole Foods.
Go on! Get out of here!
We know!
Others will know!
It isn't going to be so easy,           not anymore.
[ Rumbling ]
[ Car alarms blaring ]
[ "America the Beautiful"             playing ]
PC PRINCIPAL:  All right everyone, listen up.
I don't know about you,          but I, for one,
am sick and tired      of all the hate speech
and microaggressions       against our species.
We have a new enemy out there --      an almost invisible foe
that is so bigoted,        so racially biased,
they actually think        we should all die.
They are trying       to attract our youth,
using tactics that are      underhanded and unfair.
But no matter how hard           they hit us,
we cannot let them take          from us our PC.
And so, I have been asked   to stay on as your principal.
A lot of changes will happen       in the coming months.
The bottom line is        that the only thing
that distinguishes     those who want to kill us
from those who don't is  that we have the burning desire
