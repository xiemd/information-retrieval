[ Thumping ]
PC PRINCIPAL:     [ Muffled ] Who was it?!
Somebody's about to get        their asses kicked!
[ Children screaming ]
When I find out          who did this...
PC Principal is on the warpath!        Run for your lives!
Again?
Oh, Jesus.                        Now what?
Who was it, huh?!
Somebody better fess up            right now!
I'm gonna find out           who did this!
Broflovski!
Was it you?
Was what me, sir?
I just saw a copy      of the school newspaper
in which a student     used the word "retarded"
to refer to our cafeteria           lunch policy.
The word retarded does not       belong in our school!
Who is in charge       of the school paper?!
'Cause I'm about to break        their fucking legs!
Uh, he's in charge of the school paper.
You gonna break his legs,     PC Principal?
All right, uh, I-I guess  we haven't formally met before.
Uh, the reason  I need to talk with you, Jason,
is because of        a very important --
It's Jimmy, actually.  My name is Jimmy, PC Principal.
All right, Jim,                  thank you.
I want to talk to you today   about the use of the "R" word
in your school paper.
You see, the "R" word           is very bad.
Says who?
Says me, all right?
And I know a thing or two
about the rights of people        with disabilities.
When you use the "R" word            to describe
the school's lunch policy,   it can hurt people's hearts.
Can you understand that at all?
That was an Op-Ed piece           in the paper
written by a first grader
who found the school lunch     policy to be ridiculous,
and he thought "r-retarded" to be the best word to describe it.
As the editor of the paper,    I didn't think it was right
to censor the words         the student used.
Okay, well, from now on,     I'm gonna need to approve
the school paper before      you hand it out, okay?
No.
What'd you say?
You're new here,      so you don't understand
how seriously I take my job  as editor of the school paper.
I don't allow ads,    and I don't allow anything
that might t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking.
I don't want people       to be afraid of words
if it stops them      from having a dialogue.
Look, I don't want        to get angry, okay?
Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities?
That's okay.        Lots of people are.
No, I'm not!   I am very not uncomfortable.
All right, look -- unless I can approve your paper,
it is not being distributed     on campus. You got that?
I can't hand out    the school paper in school?
Not unless it is approved by me.        Do you understand?
Yep. Got it.
[ Tires squeak ]
Don't forget to read         the school paper,
now delivered directly           to your door!
[ Tires squeak ]
Super School News!
What is that, bro?
S-S-S-S-Suck my dick,           PC Principal!
[ Breathing heavily ]
Who does this kid think he is,          challenging me?
I said one microaggression           to him, okay?
One little microaggression,       but that doesn't mean
I have an unconscious bias
towards people        with disabilities!
No way, bro.                 That's whack!
But why would a person     with a disability not see
that what I'm trying to do     is actually protect them?
Sometimes victims of oppression              are so marginalized
that they begin to sympathize           with their oppressors.
Yeah, bro.
You're right.
This kid just needs to be shown     he's being an Uncle Able.
I can also count on my PC  frat brothers to have my back.
Let's go, PC!
ALL: PC! Whoo!
Â¶ Â¶
Wow.
Wow, this is                   so great.
Have you ever read
the elementary-school               newspaper, Linda?
There's no ads,            no sponsored content,
no links to click on,
just news stories          about what's happening.
Did you know    that the police in ShiTpaTown
beat up homeless              to clear them out?
Do you know               how long its been
since I was able to just      sit back and read the news?
I got so used to getting news               off the Internet,
but I feel like               I'm always trying
to chase the news,                   somehow.
It's like              I'm in a black void
trying to reach                the news story.
But then           the next thing I know,
I'm reading and ad                  for GEICO,
so I click out of that  and try to read the news story,
but it's not a news story,              it's a slide show,
and I'm looking                 at the worst
celebrity plastic-surgery                  jobs ever.
So, of course,     I want to see the next slide
of plastic surgery gone wrong,              so I hit the arrow.
But then the arrow wasn't    the arrow for the next slide,
it was to take me for an ad                for face cream.
Aah!
I wanted             to get a news story,
but I'm reading               about face cream,
and I try to click out of it,      but the ad is following me.
It's -- It's following me             all over the screen!
No!
So, I click           on the "close" button,
but it wasn't a "close" button,       it was another slide show.
And I just want to know               what's happening
in the Middle East,                 but instead,
I'm looking at the top 10     scariest movies of all time.
And that's not the arrow              for the next slide,
it's for another ad!
Aah!
But this --              This is just news.
And I don't get lost             in all the bullshit.
Linda.
Linda!
All right, Jim,
I know you've been trying      to get your head around
some of the social issues      we discussed yesterday.
I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
I'm not confused at all,      actually, PC Principal.
Okay, well, no,        you are confused...
I'm pretty sure you're the one  that's confused, but go ahead.
...'cause you don't grasp       the severity of this.
And that's why I've brought in
another young person         with disabilities
to share his feelings.
Thanks for coming in      to talk to us, Nathan.
I like apples                 and bananas.
Me, too, bro.             Me, too.
Nathan, could you tell Jimmy           how you feel
when people use       the word "retarded?"
It hurts my feelings              because I feel bad.
Are you serious      right now?
You feel bad. Right.
You feel like    that's a no-no word, right?
That word makes my heart                piss its pants.
Okay, wow.       That's pretty heavy.
Pretty heavy, huh, Jim?
Do you want to ask him what he means by that,
or are you just pandering
because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?
I am not uncomfortable!
I simply care about a horrible,           outdated word
that is exclusive,      ignores individuality,
and equates intellectual     disability with being --
and it -- and it -- Spot!         I need a spotter!
Spot me!      Somebody spot me, bro!
And it's -- it's part of a derogatory hate speech
which fosters isolation    and loneliness,
and being part of a voice to stop the "R" word
is not only right, but extremely important!
I'm afraid of bears.
Hey, Nathan.       Hold up.
What were you doing       in there?
What do you mean, Jimmy?                 Are you mad?
Come on, Nathan.
You and I both know
you use the word retarded         400 times a day.
Oh, Jimmy.
So righteous, aren't you?
So blind to everything         that's going on.
What are you talking about?
You really think all the changes      happening to this town
are just coincidence?
This goes so much deeper than  you can possibly imagine, Jim.
Everyone's about to learn            the truth,
and then...       there's a war coming.
A war, Jim.
And I'm just gonna make sure   I'm on the right side of it.
Come on, boys.     Let's get back to class.
I like to smell trees!
An elementary school newspaper        is making big waves
as more and more people say no     to news on the Internet.
I read Super School News 'cause it don't try and fool me,
and its news reports aren't     paid for by ad companies.
We just feel like this is actual news,
and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories.
I had to get away from the ads.
I felt that the ads were...        evolving, somehow.
They started knowing what  I liked, what I was afraid of.
I tried ad blockers,   but it seemed like every time
I tried to block the ads,      they just got smarter.
I'm never going back      from Super School News.
The young editor        of the paper claims
that since most people now watch   news reports on the Internet,
they're easily distracted      or even fooled by ads,
which are finding more and more          clever ways...                 Ooh, brutal             celebrity mug shots.
...to disguise them --
Mm, next slide.
Oh, it got me.
Ad got me, Sharon.
ANNOUNCER: We now return live to  the 2015 Presidential Debates.
Our next question is for you,           Mrs. Clinton.
Many voters believe  that Syrian refugees should not
be allowed into our country       for security reasons.
What do you think?
Keeping our country safe has  become more and more difficult,
but I believe there are         several things --
No! You shut the hell up!
You've got a dumpy butt               and seven chins.
Syrian refugees              are all terrorists!
I know  that our government
needs to take a harder look at all --
Yeah, well, it's pretty hard                to look at you.
We can all agree             on that.
She looks like a donkey took              a shit on her face.
[ Chuckles ]     Yeah, good one, Caitlyn.
See, what I know is        that there's only one way
to deal with Syrian refugees,                and that is...
ALL:    Fuck them all to death!
Thank you!
[ Both laughing ]
That was hilarious when     you called her a pizza face.
It's like a Papa John's     pimple party.
Oh, that was               classic, Caitlyn.
You're the best              running mate ever.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA:       Hello, Mr. Garrison.
Oh, my God.
Principal Victoria?
Congratulations on the polls.
We need to talk.
[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]
Celebrate diversity!         Whoo!
Let's go, PC!
All right, everyone.            Listen up.
Tonight's a very special night           for the PCs.
We're honored     to be throwing this event
for people with disabilities.
I, for one, am sick     of how these amazing kids
are marginalized        in today's society,
but tonight is about learning           and healing.
So, let's get to it! PC!
[ Cheering ]
Hey, guys. I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State.
Nice to meet you, Brad.          Where do you --
Uh, excuse me a second.    Hello, ladies.
Thanks for coming     to our event.
Hi!     Hi!
We're just tired      of the way
people with disabilities     get treated.
Can I get you     some alcohol?
Yeah, you know, it just bugs me         when people refer
to persons with disabilities          as handicapped.
When I hear that word,
I want to fucking punch them       in the fucking face.
That's so cool                 of you. Wow.
Yeah, to be marginalizing     persons with disabilities
by asking them      what their handicap is
is a microaggression no better   than asking a person of color
if they went            to college.
Wow. You're              really progressive.
No other way to be.
So, uh, listen, I think you're  really pretty and interesting,
and I'd kind of like       to take you upstairs
and totally crush            your pussy.
Would that be acceptable              to you?
Oh. [ Chuckles ]        Well, I-I guess it would.
No, I'm sorry.    I need affirmative consent.
I'll need you to say,  "Yes, you may take me upstairs
and crush my pussy          at this time."
Â¶ Â¶
McKenzie,      you got consent forms?
Oh, yeah.   Right here, bro.
Rise and shine, guys.
If you scored last night,    I need your consent forms.
Thank you.            Thank you.
Thank you. Whoa, Barker,   did you perform cunnilingus?
There's a different        release form, bro.
Yeah, uh, s-sorry.   It's right here.
Nice.
Bro!
Oh, dude! Bro!
What, bro?
Dude, I scored         with this female,
and after consenting to  putting her mouth on my penis,
she wanted me         to walk her home.                         Yeah?
And when I got to her house,
she had me meet her father,         who is Filipino.
So, I asked him     if he could tell me about
the cultural and social dynamics   of being a Filipino American.                       Naturally.
So, he said some stuff,
and then a newspaper lands         on his doorstep,
'cause I guess        her dad subscribes
to this school newspaper,
and he picked it up, and I saw      the headline said this!
What the fuck    is this, bro?!
Bro, that little kid wrote          that our tolerant views
and fight              for social justice
is just a way for us                to crush puss!
But that's not true!
I know, bro!  We're being totally victimized!
That little fucker, dude!
Hello. You're              the boy responsible
for the South Park         Super School News?
That's right.
We would like     to give you $26 million.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Latches click ]
Contracts       and the first check.
We'd love to be in business             with you.
What is this for?
I represent an organization           called GEICO.
It's an insurance company.
We think Super School News       would be a great way
for us to reach new customers.
Sorry, Charlie, but I don't    allow ads in my newspaper.
We've heard all about that,
so we thought     you could just do some...
news stories       about car insurance.
Just state the facts
because the truth is everyone  can save by switching to GEICO.
That's called       "sponsored content."
I know the difference     between the news and ads.
You think I'm stupid?
Everyone's doing it, Jim.
You're sort of         the last holdout.
$26 million  just to write some news stories
that get people thinking about     their insurance coverage?
S-S-S-Stick it up your ass.
Hm.
Well, they said          you'd be tough.
Do you really think         you can stop ads?
Yes.
You can try to block ads, but they get smarter.
The more we try         to shut them out,
the more clever they get.
There's a war coming, kid,
and I'm gonna make sure   I'm on the right side of it.
[ Gunshot ]
Officer Barbrady?
Come with me       if you want to live!
Come on! Come with me       if you want to live!
I'm serious!
Do you want to explain to me          what pussy crushing is?
What?
Your little meetings  you go to at night
to discuss   social justice --
It's just a way      to pick up on young women?!
Sharon, most of the guys     in my PC club
are right out of college,      all right?
You know how college kids are.
Who wrote this?
I don't want you        going over there anymore.
I don't cheat on you,        Sharon.
I'm happy.
Look at what's happened     to our town.
We have ShiTpaTown,
boutique restaurants,  and artisan shops.
We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me!
Diverse people   are moving here.
Everyone's being aware   of how they talk.
This is paradise,        Sharon!
Is it?
All I know          is that you've changed.
Ever since you joined                this PC thing,
you just bully people
and wait for people         to say anything improper
so that you can jump              down their throats
for whatever words                he or she used.
"He or she" is an agenderphobic microaggression, Sharon.
You are a bigot.
The average human can no longer        tell the difference
between the news and an ad.
You seem to have        some mental ability
that allows you to spot        an ad in disguise.
Does this have to do with me   calling the school principal
a pussy crusher?
The PC people are simply        being manipulated,
unwittingly setting the table  for the new enemy of humanity.
You mean ISIS or ninjas?
Something much worse.
Have you ever felt like        an ad had...intelligence?
That it somehow knew                what you wanted
even before you knew                you wanted it?
What if              I were to tell you
that ads have become                smarter than us
and now they're manipulating               everything we do?
I'd say that sounds         pretty retarded.
It was our own fault.
Mankind became tired of ads,
so we kept inventing ways      to make things ad-free.
We even created ad blockers.
That's when the ads           had to adapt.
They had to disguise themselves   as news in order to survive.
Sponsored content?
If you really can tell          the difference,
then you could be the key   to saving our species, Jimmy.
We'd like to run a test on you.
Sponsored content.
Test 17-B. Ready.
Begin.
[ Projector whirring ]
JIMMY: That's the news.
That's an ad.
That's the news.
That's an ad.
That's the news.    That's an ad. That's an ad.
That's the ne-- Oh, wait.    That's an ad for cat food.
My bad.

That's the news.           That's an ad.

[ Whirring stops ]
[ Clicks, whirs ]
That's a perfect score.
You are a very special child,        Jimmy.
I prefer "handicapped,"             actually.
We have another child here who is special, too.
Do you know Leslie?
[ Dramatic music plays ]
All right. That's good.       Everyone get inside.
Everything past here          is safe space.
No reporters, no harassment.
We're gonna figure          this shit out.
All I know is that  I don't speak up for minorities
so that I can crush pussy.
Me, neither, dude.
I want social justice,  and now I'm being made fun of.
Yeah, bro.
They're taking our incredibly tolerant views
and distorting them.
PC people are under attack.       That's what this is.
Hey, yeah.
Bro, we're the victims now.
Like, we're being marginalized.
Like, that makes us pretty cool.
Yeah, I'll bet now we can get               a lot more puss.
No, Topher!  It's not about puss, all right?
The fuck's wrong with you?
We're being labeled           as meat heads
who just want to crush puss    by an intolerant newspaper.
Yeah, fuck that dude,         bro.
Yeah, and, like,     if you're gonna belittle
and make fun of PC people            like that,
then who's to say          he won't do it
to other marginalized groups             like us?
I mean, this kid could be         the next Hitler.
And if you guys could  stop Hitler, what would you do?
I'd rip that dude apart               and then go home
and totally smash                some puss, bro.
-Yeah!           -Hell, yeah!
-Hell, yeah, dude!               -No!
[ Dramatic music plays ]
You look familiar.       Don't you go to my school?
Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy,
Editor in Chief of Super School News.
I'm Leslie.
Nice to finally talk        to you.
Did they bring you in and give       you a bunch of tests, too?
Yes, the did. Do you know who they are?
I think            they're ex-newsmen --
you know,                the men in suits
who used to be in charge                  of the news.
I thought   I recognized them.
They told me                 I was special.
Are you special, too?
I prefer handicapped.
[ Chuckles ]                  I like that.
Principal Victoria,
if everything you've said             is true,
then why doesn't anyone          know about it?
There are people                   who know,
but they have to stay                 very hidden.
I'm just having a hard time       swallowing all this.
And between me      and this one over here,
we can swallow       just about anything.
[ Chuckles ] God, you're such an asshole.
Mr. Garrison,                I wasn't fired.
I was replaced.
This goes much higher              than anyone knows.
I came to this town
really thinking I could make           a difference.
I've been called a bigot towards    persons with disabilities.
I've been called         a...pussy crusher
because of the behavior
of a very few individuals          in my PC frat.
Jimmy Valmer   is off the school newspaper.
I want you to take over.
Oh, boy!
And I will be reviewing      your paper to make sure
nobody is ever attacked       the way I was again.
I think this will be           the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
Jimmy almost made me         lose confidence,
but I know who I am.
I know what I am.
MAN: Dude! Bro!
Oh, bro.
I went online to read a news story
about immigrants being discriminated against.
Yeah. Well, and so I clicked    on the headline,
but it turned out to be an ad for Reddi-wip,
so then I clicked  on the "X" button  to make it go away,
but then it was a link    to another ad,
and when I tried    to cancel that,
another window came up,   and it was this.
Dude,            what the fuck, bro?
What does this mean,        dude?!
Bro,           what the fuck, bro?!
Do you like our school,                     Jimmy?
Uh, yes, Leslie.  I like our school very much.
I like our school, too.
I like the kids                 who go there.
Uh-huh.
I'm starting to wonder something  about you, Leslie.
I'm starting to wonder                   about you.
I mean, you seem like                  a nice kid,
but don't you feel       like you could be happier?
Holy shit.                         What?
Can you excuse me     for a moment?
Okay.
Well, Jimmy?  What do you think?
Does she know           she's an ad?
He can spot them.
Does she kn-know           she's an ad?!
What the hell         is going on, bro?
Bro?
Bro, what the hell  is going on, bro?!
If we're going back,                  remember --
We don't know               who we can trust.
If they want to mess     with my town,
I'll fuck every last     one of them.
Let's do this!
[ Engine turns over ]       Buckle up, buckaroos!
[ Tires squeal ]
[ People screaming ]
Hey, yeah.
Bro, we're the victims now.
Like, we're being marginalized.
Like, that makes us pretty cool.
Yeah, I'll bet now we can get               a lot more puss.
No, Topher!  It's not about puss, all right?
The fuck's wrong with you?
