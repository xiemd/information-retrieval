    "\n",
    "In this assignment, given a Yelp review, your task is to implement two classifiers to predict if the business category of this review is \"food-relevant\" or not, **only based on the review text**. The data is from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to download this data file as your training data: [training_data.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_13wIEAmbQMdzBVTndwenoxQlk) \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data file includes 40,000 Yelp reviews. Each line is a json-encoded review, and **you should only focus on the \"text\" field**. As same as in homework 1, you should tokenize the review text by using the regular expression \"\\W+\" (we discussed it in [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/ixkk1fy863r1vs?cid=29). Do NOT remove stop words. **Do casefolding but no stemming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The label (class) information of each review is in the \"label\" field. It is **either \"Food-relevant\" or \"Food-irrelevant\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing data\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide 100 yelp reviews here: [testing_data.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_13wIEAmbQMbXdyTkhrZDN4Wms). The testing data file has the same format as the training data file. Again, you can get the label informaiton in the \"label\" field. Only use it when you evalute your classifiers."

    "2. The reason i think is that naive bayes consider the probability of each word in the document while the Rocchio use a vector to represent the document. In Rocchio method, calculating the centroid of two classses may loss the latent characteristic of some documents. Meanwhile, the naive bayes method capture the every term's probability and also a global term probability. That's why Naive Bayes out perform the Rocchio method."
