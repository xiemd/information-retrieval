Being that I am a friend of one of the employees, I got a tour of how they make their pho. I posted three photos from the kitchen (grilling onions, ingredients, and simmering pot). They use an assortment of beef and beef bones with the ingredients in the pictures. They told me it takes about 12 hours of simmering to make the soup. \n\nI have been to many pho places in LV and here in Colorado. It may be a subtle difference, but most pho places' soup base isn't as flavorful as the one I had at Pho Lan.

I chose this place because they have a website with their menu online! I'm hoping that they will add pictures to every menu item on their website so that my mom and I can let our stomachs and eyes order for us :). We called in our order and drove about 20 minutes to the restaurant. We showed up the day before their Grand Opening so we missed the restaurant when we drove down the road (they have a nice bright sign now though, so you can't miss it)! We were promptly greeted and our food was brought out right away. \n\nMy mom loves to talk so we enjoyed a fun conversation with everyone. They got us to try the melon juice and halo halo and I'm glad they did. The melon juice is like a shredded melon boba :). They add shaved ice to melon juice with shredded melon at the bottom. Super yummy- especially on a hot day. My mom and I couldn't agree on the halo halo though. I like simple halo halo while my mom loves \"loaded\" halo halo with tons of stuff (like the cup is full of beans and jellies and fruit) and D'Pinoy's halo halo is definitely more simple (maybe about a quarter full). I loved it but I'm sure my mom will ask for more fixings in hers next time. The Philippines might seem like a small country but there are many regional differences. Some people just prefer things a certain way because of the region they grew up in. \n\nWe ordered several things including lumpiang shanghai, fried bangus (milkfish), beef kaldereta, chicken curry, pancit bihon, binagoongan fried rice, and beef bulalo. I loved their pancit but my mom didn't care for the tofu in it so I took it all :). The chicken curry has bones but the chicken is very soft and will fall right off it. The beef in the beef bulalo is super soft and absolutely delicious. The binagoongan rice wasn't what I was expecting (it has mangoes and tomatoes on the side- never seen that before) but it was absolutely delicious. Very unique and very tasty! Everything was very good, very soft, and cooked very well. \n\nUnfortunately, we were missing one thing in our order and didn't notice until we got home (oops)! The place isn't that close to us so my mom called back and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and promised to make it right when we return. And we WILL return! I want to try the pork tonkatsu, dinuguan, sinigaang, and the sizzling bistek!

Snacks dipping dots were the best, pretzels, cinnamon sticks etc..\n\n- Drinks you can bring in water they check bags so no other drinks or food. They serve all sorts of beverages including beer be prepared to show id and wait for a manager for any alcohol a plus but a hassle to wait.\n\n- You can bring in your own shade structure within size reason. \n\n- Lots of chairs but get their early to find a shaded spot they have lots of shade areas but they go fast this is ongoing with all water parks that I have been to.\n\n-  Fun colorful atmosphere the props are diverse some are vintage others look like Disney props a nice mixture for adults and kids to enjoy.\n\nCon's\n- Signs need to be added as to how to get to certain slides and lazy river/ wave pool\n\n- Misters so your feet don't get too hot ( I suggest  flip flops when walking around )\n\n- Zooma ride way to long of a wait between riders speed it up.\n\n- Weight limit on pink slide bummer my husband could not ride it but glad to here a new slide is going in that seats more that 2.

I thought they have the whole last year and this year to complete the park. Oh well.\n\nSince the park is still missing 3 main attractions, they decided to lower the price by $6 for adult. \n\nAnyway, we went on a Thursday, a week after it opened. Parking was $5. I was expecting huge crowd like at Wet n Wild, but to my surprise it was no where as crowded as I had thought. Almost all the slides were a walk-on during the early morning into mid-afternoon hours. I overheard one of the lifeguards told the another guest that this was one of the slowest day since it opened a week ago. It may be due to the fact that it was cloudy and looked like it was going to rain.\n\nThe longest we waited for a slide was on Zuma ZOOMa. I would have to say this ride is the only extreme water slide in the park. It has a trap door underneath you, that will drop you in 5 seconds once you step in and they close the glass door. It was very thrilling. \n\nHere's a point of view video I shot of this Zuma ZOOMA trap door body slide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMDqgckVUoo\n\nFood is a bit pricey since it's an amusement park. What do you expect? they need to make money somehow since most of the guests are season pass holder, they pay once and get to come back as often as they want. So in order to stay in business, they need to boost up their prices on food.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this park! It's so vivid and colorful. I can't wait to come back next summer when everything is completed and they have planted more trees and shrubs.  \n\nI don't know why, but I love Cowabunga Bay more than Wet N Wild Las Vegas. \n\nBy the way, here's a video showing a FULL Complete Tour of Cowabunga Bay Las Vegas for those who wants to see how it looks like before going\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmOs8Sc5tm0", "business_id": "UH4BReVAqpMVjyVroEJAGA", "label": "Food-irrelevant", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-15", "type": "review"}

I think the park is great and very excited to have it so close.  I realize the park is not finished but just have some minor complaints. \n1st- the pebbles that are used for landscaping really hurt when you step on them, maybe you could put a lil fence around so people walk on the pathway instead of through the landscaping.\n2nd- There needs to be more shade while waiting to ride the tube slides at the bottom.  The shade only seems to work when the sun is directly above, other than that you are frying in the sun. \n3rd- Be carful for the concrete around the top of the lazy river it is very rough and roughed my husbands arm up a bit, nothing bad.\n4th- Please sell the Dole whip in a smaller size, not just large.  We LOVE Dole whip and are so excited we don't have to drive to boulder city anymore, but a large is way to much.\nOther than that thank you for coming to Henderson.

I so very much wanted to enjoy this place. It's always an amazing day when you find that a fairly pretentious coffee house is being replaced with something a lot less so! The restaurant is literally across the road from my work and would be an excellent Friday treat for myself and the rest of the office.\n\nThe decor is typical of a lot of places these days - exposed brickwork, unpainted woodwork, hodge-podge furniture etc. And the staff were very accommodating and friendly. All very much a positive, imo.\n\nThere were 4 of us in our party and the 3 guys all opted for the cheese burger, and 2 of them had fries on the side, and I being veggie, had the 1 option on the menu - the Magic Mushroom Burger. All burgers cost the same amount: \u00a37.50 and this is where things get a bit....erm...meh....\n\nThe food arrived around 30 minutes after we sat down. We were all presented with greaseproof paper mats, on top of which came our paper-wrapped burgers. Call me old fashioned, but I like plates or boards to eat off of! This is essentially fast food at gourmet prices. My \u00a37.50 got me a brioche bun with a mildly spicy bean patty, a mushroom, a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, a bit of salad and a mildly spicy salsa. It's important to note that all sides are separate. I remember looking enviously at the gherkins which the guys seemed to have and thinking that just a bit of 'pep' might have changed my entire experience. There's a common misconception that veggie sometimes means bland. Maybe the introduction of some spicy condiments might help out here. I felt a little short-changed, if I'm honest. The Southern, for example, offers a multiple choice of veggie options and comes with a side of fries and a side of slaw for around 50p more. \n\nI really don't want this to be a damning review, after all the 3 guys who I was with absolutely loved their meals, but I just came away feeling that the vegetarian option was simply tacked on to appease folk like me. I will go back as my better half wants to check it out, but I think the next time I really want a burger, I will go to the Southern or Wanaburger and get a hell of a lot more bang for my buck, both in terms of value and actual sustenance.", "business_id": "EYpqqsJZ3L2EFAPK-NEOFA", "label": "Food-relevant", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-15", "type": "review"}

Usually lemon pepper is my favorite and my go to but in this case I really liked the honey bbq and would order it again.  \n\nThey offer 15 flavors of wings but the new owner said there would be more.  So that is a major difference between Wing King and this new spot.  The Wing King menu had 60 flavors and offered dessert.  They don't currently offer dessert so the yelp check in won't be honored.  I have to take away one star because they could be more generous with the ranch and the blue cheese.

Wing King. *Record scratch. Huh? This aint Wing King!\n\nApparently, its a whole new owner and he named it 702 Wing Spot. Now being the open minded Yelper that I am I was more than willing to give these guys a spin.\n\nWhat I got was the Rat Pack ($9.99). You get one sauce for 10 pieces of wings, fries, and a drink. I wanted to play it safe so I got just honey barbeque.\n\nWhen they brought out my order, it was only 9 wings and they noticed it as soon as they put it down in front of me. They said to just go ahead and start eating and they will bring out the other piece. At first I was thinking that this was a bad first impression. But about 5 minutes later they brought out 3 pieces because they felt bad about their mistake. I was impressed. \n\nAs for the wings, not bad. Not bad at all. I think I will go for more bolder sauces next time like Mango Habanero. The fries were sprinkled with some type of cajun spices which made it pretty good. Not as good as sweet chili glazed fries but good nonetheless. Lastly, you get a 12 ounce can of soda. Not a bad deal for 10 bucks.\n\nAs a bonus, when you check in you get a free dessert! At that time, not all the desserts were available because he just opened so I ended up going with the cheesecake on a stick which normally sells for $3.99. If you refer to my pic, it is a nice sized goodie for you guys with a sweet tooth! It had a rich taste to it just like how a good cheesecake should be.\n\nOriginally I was gonna give them 4 stars but the service more than made up for that supposedly bad first impression. I like these guys. A bit different than Wing King but I am more than happy to recommend these them. For those that are not familiar with this place, they are located in a strip mall kind of setting with other food joints of different ethnicity.

If you've never been to the Presto in Southwest Vegas, you probably don't know that PC offers up breakfast, sandwiches, coffee, smoothies, juices, salads, and pides (Turkish flatbread, pronounced 'pee-day').  There are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free items on the menu, something for everyone.  I met Shirley B. here for a late lunch and we both had sandwiches, turkey for me and the vegetarian for her, plus she had their beet salad.  Both sandwiches were a nice size, easily big enough to have one half now and the other half later; that's what Shirley did, but I was piggish and ate the whole thing there.  Consisting of turkey, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mayo on a toasted cranberry walnut bread, PC's turkey sandwich is an especially hearty and tasty version of an item that tends to be boring at most places. \n\nLocated in the same shopping plaza as Gold's Gym, I'm sure the fitness fanatics are happy that PC is here, too.  It's also right next door to Gimme Some Sugar, so if you want to be fit first, then a little fat later, you can kill two birds with one stone.  \n\nOpen from 8:00am-8:00pm daily.", "business_id": "OEUIE8VBa1BbBfr5EPcTOA", "label": "Food-relevant", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-07", "type": "review"}

There's no doubt Im really diggin' this new cafe.  If you worked up an appetite at the gym nearby, they have great healthy options for you here! When I feel like a carnivore or not , they've got it covered too. What appealed to me was the superfoods like Kale, Beets, and Quinoa in the salads and the artisinal breads and cheeses used for the sandwiches.  All healthy, fresh ingredients, and mega delish!\n \nMy orders so far have been salads, their vegetarian sandwich and custom made juice. The prices are inexpensive, my meals so far have averaged $11. That's pretty good for a place that specializes in healthier choices. You know my gripe about healthy smoothies and juices that cost as much as my lunch. (ahem PH) Well here it's much more reasonable.  So you healthy smoothie fanatics might want to try it for sure.\n \nNice variety of salads in their cold case display that you can choose from. Sold by the scoop starting at $2.75 depending on which salad you get. You can add side of protien to it also.  Scoop equals about a small bowl portion and it didn't leave me starving. The first time I was there I got two different salads and couldn't finish it.  \n\n== Mint Vinaigrette== what a novel idea for the the Kale, Quinoa, Cranberries, Cashews, Feta salad! Dressing light and compliments with the Kale. \n\nAnd Beets, and I detect Oranges? Something citrusy. Ingredients are the perfect engery/refuel booster before or after your workout at the gym.\n\nThe Tandoori Chicken with mango and coconut and Cauliflower Kale with raisins are the more exotic creations spiced with curry...and you know I love yellow curry.\n\nMeatless Monday I got the Vegetarian Sandwich. So good even non vegetarians like me love it. This one was roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, GOAT CHEESE, olive tapanade on a 9 grain bread. Just BRILLIANT!\n\nThe cafe is pretty chill. Dining area cafe style with just a few tables and high-tops and a picnic bench outdoors if you dare to eat out there in this heat.  \n\nService dining in has been cool so far. Order and pay first at counter. They'll bring food out to your table. Our orders came out in a timely manner. I didn't order anything that needed to be grilled or cooked though. The staff has been really nice and friendly. They already recognize their regular customers . \n\nThey need to hurry up and get that ice tea or brewed tea in. Im not a fan of carbonated sodas and a cheaper alternative to juices and smoothies would be nice. A paper take out menu would be handy too. I was told to look it up online but not everyone is capable of looking it up. Those are some small kinks they need to work on based on my visits. \n\nThey are just four days into their soft opening phase. Word of mouth spread thru the crew from Gimme Some Sugar next door is how I found out! Go figure!

I try to eat well but my choices are pretty limited when I am out showing houses. Fast food tends to make me crash in the late afternoon so I try to avoid that. When I heard that Presto Caf\u00e9 was going to open up down in Henderson, I was very anticipative.  I was not disappointed.  I walked in just after lunch time to see the place still pretty full.  The decor was nice and it felt very clean inside.  I also noticed that they had free Wi-Fi which is fantastic for those of us on the go.\nI am a devout carnivore but I decided that I would put Presto Caf\u00e9 to the test, so I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich with the Tropical Wake Up Smoothie.  I took a seat and waited for my order.  It was obvious that people REALLY enjoy eating there.  I noticed the owner, Reza Arshandi, talking with everyone and making them feel at home.  It was great to see everyone enjoying their meal.  You can tell that Reza takes great pride in the food he serves his customers.\nWhen my food arrived, I was very pleased by the presentation.  The sandwich came with a wonderful strawberry and apple salad on the side.  When I took my first sip of my smoothie it was obvious that it was not made from one of those sugary mixes.  I could taste the fruit and it was not heavy at all.  I was also very happy with the sandwich.  Even though the sandwich had eggplant, tomatoes and oil, the bread never got soggy.  It was a great blend of flavors and was very satisfying.  After I was finished I felt full but still energetic which was great because I had a busy afternoon ahead.\nIt's great to find the perfect combination of high quality food, generous servings and good prices.  I was in and out in less time than a normal restaurant but this is not fast food.  It is a great place to go if you want to sit down and relax and still be done in 30 min or so.  I also noticed that I still felt very fresh and full around 4pm.

When I heard they open another one on the opposite side of town in Henderson. Hell yay! Can never have enough of good thing in life. Best part is both locations is located off 215 so got north and south side of town check and double check. I was going with my favorite either the turkey or reuben sandwich. I figure new location mark try something never had before. I went with the Meatball Sandwiches. Three Meatball sliders. Anyone would be crazy not too get scoop of one of the Presto salads. My go to is always the israeli couscous salad. I love the combination of the mushrooms, perfect couscous, and some truffle oil tossed in with some herbs. I could order three scoops and be in couscous heaven with nice bowl. The Meatball sliders too be honestly VERY surprised the way it turned out. Comes too my sandwich at Presto have my fav and meatball sandwich meatballs nothing gets me personally excited. I ended up having was three amazing sliders! The brioche mini buns (always wrote that sandwich starts with the bread filling second) awesome. It had the nice crust on the outside, moist on the inside, and any slider combination would be the bomb with those buns. The meatball is very tasty. It nice nice depth of flavor and seasonings. Combine just right about of pomodoro sauce (pet peeves overkill on tomato sauce in meatball is recipe for disaster), the cheese, and right about of bread. Some of the best sliders I have had in sometime. I never been too the more upscale meatball restaurant. You pay price of one meatball that can get three meatball sliders. I can tell you would take some Presto Cafe Meatballs hand down over the pricey name brand. I love small business owners and seeing Presto grow from one too two restaurant. Awesome. \n\nThe food totally felt like it was the same quality getting at the other location. They are some differences besides the obvious location. The display for the salads are little different. I prefer the other location only because you have more choices and  looks more appealing nicely lined up side by side. This location not as much in bigger containers, two different levels, and different vibe. Thankfully the quality is still as good as it gets. The new location hold more people in the restaurant. The interior design much more of open kitchen look and seems brighter with the paint color scheme. They do have wi-fi. I not sure if the other location has since I never used it at Presto. \n\nThe customer service was awesome. We lucked out Suzy H and I after training day no one in the place just us.

I was transported right back to NY and the original movie theaters of my childhood. Well, all except the fact this one has a bar, a cool lounge, and some great art hanging on the walls. lol. I had never been here before so was very happy to score an invite. My \"Plus One friend\" loves it here so she was raring to go. I adore the Roosevelt Row area so much so we added this to the really cool things to do in Downtown. Bonus points for eating at Trumpets Ale before the gig. Two new places in one night on Roosevelt Row spells awesomeness. \n\nWe tried all day to guess which \"surprise, locally filmed movie\" they were going to show. I kept guessing \"Raising Az\" because it is the SunDevil in me. CG hates that one. We sparred all day. I crossed my fingers she wouldn't just walk out if they played that one. All her picks were awesome too! We hope to see any of them in the next few months as Yelp picks. Surprisingly, it was really exciting to go to a theater when you had no idea what movie was going to be shown until the credits started flowing. ( I see this as a new home movie party trend)  Az has a long history of movie magic and we had over 200 films to chose from. We were all on the edge of our seats. When the first words to pop up were \"A Lorne Michaels Film\" We heard a loud, \"WOOP!\" from some fellow Rowdy Yelpers.  I still did not know which SNL film it was until the title popped up. I was pretty surprised. I thought I knew most of the films on the local list but forgot about Wayne's World. Lol-- how funny. I relived some of my eighties college music days and definitely those hair band experiences growing up on Long Island listening to Metal/Rock groups like; Zebra, Alice Cooper, and Poison. (Just to name a few)  \n\nWe had a great time tonight. We can not wait to go back. Coincidentally, I had just watched \"World's End\" last night. FilmBar is having a \"Shaun of the Dead\" party on the 25th. I think I heard something about a Zombie Pinata, and that dressing up party Shenanigans were predicted to ensue. Yes, please.
